* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 2, was a favorite of mine because of its practicality in the real world, which is why I had the most fun working on it. This part of Lab 7 involved whether street 
parking is allowed during a specific timeframe, following the regulations of street signs. In addition, my partner and I implemented several if-statements, all of which added 
an extra layer of complexity to our program. In retrospect, the concept of conditional statements fascinates me because it’s similar to making a decision. Some may be trivial, 
and others, not so much. Whatever the case may be, we won’t know for sure what the outcome might be because well, quite frankly, we haven’t experienced it yet! But it’s that 
thought that always keeps me wondering to what extent an effect may have if a specific path is chosen. Although this lab shows very little of that, learning how to use 
conditional statements in real-world scenarios was interesting in and of itself.
