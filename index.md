### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2, was a favorite of mine because of its practicality in the real world, which is why I had the most fun working 
on it. This part of Lab 7 involved whether street parking is allowed during a specific timeframe, following the regulations of 
street signs. In addition, my partner and I implemented several if-statements, all of which added an extra layer of complexity 
to our program. In retrospect, the concept of conditional statements fascinates me because it’s similar to making a decision. 
Some may be trivial, and others, not so much. Whatever the case may be, we won’t know for sure what the outcome might be 
because well, quite frankly, we haven’t experienced it yet! But it’s that thought that always keeps me wondering to what extent 
an effect may have if a specific path is chosen. Although this lab shows very little of that, learning how to use conditional 
statements in real-world scenarios was interesting in and of itself.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2, was also one of my favorites. This part involved guessing the other player’s secret number. It was 
relatively easy to code, using a combination of std::cout/cin and if-statements, but, I found it to have a lot of charm to 
it as well. Its simplistic yet creative design was reminiscent of old-school arcades. Games like Pong and Donkey Kong were 
all straightforward games with only one goal in mind yet, they offered an enjoyable experience for players. Further, this 
program reminded me of the first game I made in high school, which I spent several hours developing and refining.
